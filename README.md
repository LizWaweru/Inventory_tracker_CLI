This system is built using Python and SQLAlchemy, providing CRUD operations for users keep track of stock levels. It allows business manage supplier information, and monitor transaction histories, providing a robust solution for inventory management.

## Models and relationships

- Inventory-Transaction:One-to-many relationship. An inventory can have multiple transactions but a transaction is related to one inventory item.
- Category: One category can have many inventories.
- Supplier: One-to-many;A supplier can supply many inventories.

   git clone https://git@github.com:crea-tivecoder/Inventory_tracker_CLI.git
   cd Inventory_tracker_CLI
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- Install the required packages

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

- Generating Pipenv
  Install any dependencies you'll need for your project, like SQLAlchemy and Alembic

```bash
pipenv install sqlalchemy alembic
```

### Generating Your Database

Once you're in your environment, you can start development.
Setting up your database.
`cd` into the `lib/db` directory, then run `alembic init migrations` to set up Alembic.
Modify line 63 in `alembic.ini` to point to the database you intend to create, then replace line 26 in `migrations/env.py` with the following:

```py
from models import Base
target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

Navigate to `lib/db` and start creating the models.
Regularly run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m'<descriptive message>'` and
`alembic upgrade head` to track your modifications to the database and create checkpoints in case of any need to roll the modifications back.

Run `cli.py` script to generate some test data.

### Generating Your CLI

A CLI is, simply put, an interactive script. You can run it with `python cli.py`
or include the shebang and make it executable with `chmod +x`.

`print()` statements in the CLI script let the
user know the input message they would want to choose from.
